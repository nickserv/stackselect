# StackSelect

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickmccurdy/stackselect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickmccurdy/stackselect)

Quizzes that help developers select technologies.

## Goals

* Automate asking people for advice about what tech to use.
* Fight the catch 22 problem of picking the wrong technology to learn because you don’t understand its strengths and weaknesses compared to alternatives.
* All quizzes result in a free, open source, and well supported technology.

## [Quizzes](quizzes.md)

StackSelect is in the early planning/design phase as we decide how to structure quizzes and what content to include. There is example content in our Quizzes document, and we are open to contributions for additional quiz content.
